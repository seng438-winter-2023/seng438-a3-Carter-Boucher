# 1 Introduction

Similar to assignment 2 this lab will introduce to the idea of test coverage for unit testing. It is also an introduction to the idea of white box testing. White box testing is important because it allows the tester to have a deeper understanding of the code, it makes for a more thorough testing phase. This is because it tests all possible code paths.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Text…

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Text…

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
